# ROS 2 Default RMW TSC reports

## Introduction

Each year, [ROS 2](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/) is released on [World Turtle Day](https://www.worldturtleday.org/).
For every ROS 2 release, the [ROS 2 TSC](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Governance.html) votes on the [default RMW](https://docs.ros.org/en/rolling/Concepts/About-Different-Middleware-Vendors.html) for the release.
In order for the TSC to make an informed decision, [Open Robotics](https://www.openrobotics.org/) produces a report on the state of the available RMWs.
The list below links to each of the available reports.
