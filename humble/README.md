# 2021 ROS Middleware Evaluation Report

## Default DDS vendor template

On August 31, 2021, the vendors in contention for the default DDS vendor in ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill were provided with a set of questions to answer about their implementation.
The questionnaire is available [here](dds_provider_question_template.md).

Once responses from that questionnaire are received, a full report will be produced.
